apiVersion: v1
# Th type of object we want to create
kind: Pod
#Config options for the object we are about to create
metadata:
  # When the pod is created, give it a name of 'posts'
  name: posts
#The exact attribute we want to apply to the object we are about to create
spec:
  # we can create many containers in a single pod
  containers:
    # Make a container with a name of 'posts' ( "-" means array entry). If more containers, think about name more specificallycontainers
    - name: posts
      # The exact image we want to use
      # we want version number here and not latest (default), Kuber look into docker hub and look for this latest version (remember it will look in local first, so make distinction)
      image: johnchan/posts:0.0.1

      ***This is really the deployment, don't really create pods like this
